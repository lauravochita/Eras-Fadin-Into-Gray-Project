# ERAS FADIN INTO GRAY Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the ERAS FADIN' INTO GRAY Project repository. This project is designed for research purposes and includes datasets, models, and notebooks related to the analysis of song lyrics. The project uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and includes pre-trained models and results, as well as a k-means clustering algorithm for automated curation of thematically cohesive playlists. This project was conducted as research for the completion of the Bachelor's degree.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ERAS_FADIN_INTO_GRAY_Project.git
    cd ERAS_FADIN_INTO_GRAY_Project
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You can install the required packages using pip and the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Unzip the datasets and models**:
    Unzip `Datasets.zip`, `LDA Results.zip`, `Playlists.zip`, and `Pre-Trained LDA Model.zip` in the repository directory.
    ```bash
    unzip Datasets.zip
    unzip LDA Results.zip
    unzip Playlists.zip
    unzip Pre-Trained LDA Model.zip
    ```
